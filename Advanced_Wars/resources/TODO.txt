Implemented, untested:    then attack choice, 
Implemented, untested:    then one attack and one move per turn, unless artillery-movement costs an attack, 



then health fields and drawing, (Only draw health if the display health is less than 10)
then attack math, 
then defense points, 
gain X money at the end of the turn (1000 per building)
lose X money at end of turn and repair occurs if injured units on on buildings (2 health repair ??? cost)
then capturing city mechanic, 
then capturing HQ Game Over, then it is done.










Dont' do this:

update paint of units if their attacked this turn is true; maybe gray them out a bit.  This probably won't work because the game does movements and attacks separately, so it wouldn't allow graying out units that have moved.
