Update tab, 1, 2, 3, 4 hotkeys.  Just make them simulate clicks by updating the clicked values, easy enough.

















Implemented, untested:    then attack choice,
Implemented, untested:    then one attack and one move per turn, unless artillery-movement costs an attack, 
Implemented, and tested:    then health fields and drawing, (Only draw health if the display health is less than 10)
Implemented, untested:    then attack math,
Implemented, untested:    then defense points, 
Implemented, untested:    destroy units and remove them from lists when they lose all health




Finished capturing?
Apply filter to sprite to gray out when moved





cursor starts at HQ each turn, do this by updating the mouseX and mouseY to the HQ; store the HQ locations at start.
Draw black boxes around the health
why are no there no counter attacks?
why does damage do so little, perhaps that is normal, log the damage and health values!


Implemented, untested:    gain X money at the end of the turn (1000 per building)
lose X money at end of turn and repair occurs if injured units on on buildings (2 health repair ??? cost)
then capturing city mechanic, 
then capturing HQ Game Over, then it is done.






terrainReduction = 1% per health per star

(Base + random number 0 to 9) * terrainReduction (if 40% then 0.6)  ie. answer 35.28 is 35%


base * (% health you have) * terrainReduction









Base = Base damage (in damage chart)
R = random number 0-9
AHP = HP of attacker (out of 10 I think)
DTS = defender terrain stars (plain = ??, mountain = ??)
DHP = defender HP (out of 10 I think)

attack math:

(Base+R) * (AHP/10) * [(200-(DTS*DHP))/100]

counter damage must be whatever is left,then they get to attack you back with that.




Dont' do this:

update paint of units if their attacked this turn is true; maybe gray them out a bit.  This probably won't work because the game does movements and attacks separately, so it wouldn't allow graying out units that have moved.
